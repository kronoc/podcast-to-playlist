			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soundtracks, library and television music with Jonny Trunk. Today Ian Helliwell is coming onto the OST Show. Ian lives in Brighton, is somewhat of an archivist and dare we say it, a polymath. He has spent the last few years, investigating (amongst many other things) the life and work of a certain F.C. Judd. Frederick Judd was responsible for some very early electronic music in the UK, wrote extensively on the subject and much of his musical work was issued on the Studio G library label. Ian has also made a full length film about this great, inventive man, &#8216;Practical Electronics&#8217; and a new compilation of his Judd&#8217;s work &#8216;Electronics Without Tears&#8217; is about to be released on the rather marvellous Public Information label. And pretty fabulous they both are too. The stage is set for a journey into the deeply strange and utterly wondrous soundworld. And don&#8217;t be fooled by the skip in the first few seconds, this is actually a lovely high-quality 320kbps mp3 file, which as you will know is CD quality. We really are too good to you&#8230; </p>

Result!</p>
<p>Incidentally, sorry this week&#8217;s podcast isn&#8217;t a bit more Christmassy. Robin The Fog popped down to the OST archive to try and find something a bit more seasonal, but then left his USB stick at the Resonance Christmas party. So you&#8217;ll just have to slap this one on while sitting around the festive table instead. A pretty decent compromise, don&#8217;t you think? </p>
<p>Happy Christmas, OST fans! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekly programme is dedicated to film music, TV music, library music and related recordings, and is hosted by Jonny Trunk. Each week The OST Show welcomes a guest (a collector, composer, director, artist) or specialises in a specific film music genre or composer. Today Jonny is proud to be able to play the first ever full recording of Les Baxter&#8217;s score to The Man With X Ray Eyes. A mixture of exotics, oddness and bizarre instrumentation, this superb sci fi horror score for Corman&#8217;s 1963 classic (also known simply as &#8220;X&#8221;) is well worth the 48 year wait. He also has an unreleased Schifrin score but you&#8217;ll have to tune in to hear all about it!</p>

		<itunes:summary>This weekly programme is dedicated to film music, TV music, library music and related recordings, and is hosted by Jonny Trunk. Each week The OST Show welcomes a guest (a collector, composer, director, artist) or specialises in a specific film music genre or composer. Today Jonny is proud to be able to play the first ever full recording of Les Baxter's score to The Man With X Ray Eyes. A mixture of exotics, oddness and bizarre instrumentation, this superb sci fi horror score for Corman's 1963 classic (also known simply as "X") is well worth the 48 year wait. He also has an unreleased Schifrin score but you'll have to tune in to hear all about it!</itunes:summary>

To celebrate the launch of &#8220;Living In The Material World&#8221;, a brand new book featuring the personal archives of George Harrison, the OST Show is dedicating itself to the man, his film music and the soundtracks from the output of his Handmade Films Company, originally broadcast 1st October 2011. There was a competition too with a pretty cool prize, but you&#8217;ve obviously missed that because this is a podcast, and you can&#8217;t go back, no matter what those fellows in Switzerland might have you believe.

In this archive edition from June 2011, Jonny feels moved to play the music of the veteran composer, arranger and general cool cat Michel Legrand. The reason for this venture, not that it particularly needs one, is that Jonny had been to see the great man give a thoroughly satisfactory performance at Ronnie Scott&#8217;s a few days previously, and felt compelled to prepare a tribute episode away from the distractions of courting couples and chickens in a basket&#8230;</p>

Today on the OST Show he&#8217;s joined by John Flannery, member of the test card circle.

<p>We&#8217;d also like to apologise for the extreme slackness of uploading fresh OST podcasts in the last month or two. This is because it&#8217;s normally left to Robin The Fog to sort it out, and frankly of late he hasn&#8217;t been cutting the mustard. However, with a quiet word and a punch in the chops, normal service looks set to be resumed. Look out for veritable cavalcade of new and old OST podcasts coming very soon! We faithfully promise&#8230;</p>
