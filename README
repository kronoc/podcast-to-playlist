You will need the following modules from cpan to use podcast2playlist:

LWP::UserAgent; XML::RSS::Parser; Date::Parse;


Example uses

Output an m3u from a podcast:

podcast2playlist.pl user "you@email.example" url http://test.test/podcast.xml > playlist.m3u

Output an m3u from a local podcast file:

podcast2playlist.pl url localfile.xml > playlist.m3u

Output a CSV from a podcast:

podcast2playlist.pl user "you@email.example" url http://test.test/podcast.xml delim "," > playlist.csv

Output a simple (most recent) item from a podcast:

podcast2playlist.pl user "you@email.example" url http://test.test/podcast.xml limit 1 > single-item-playlist.m3u

Output the 5 most recent items from a podcast as a playlist in JSON(!):

podcast2playlist.pl user "you@email.example" url http://test.test/podcast.xml limit 5 delim '","url":"' output_start '[{"url":"' output_end '"}]'  > playlist.json

Playlists are sorted by date, newest item first. Other sorting methods will appear some time when I can be bothered.
