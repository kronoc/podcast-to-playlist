      <title>Group agents</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>On this Philosopher’s Zone we’re looking at agents. Not secret agents but rather public agents: an agent is just somebody who does something for a purpose and an agent is distinguished from a patient. The agent is the person who does things and the patient is the person to whom things are done. But do we have to be talking about individual persons here or can groups of people be agents in the way that individuals can? This week, we investigate.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Michael Dummett: a philosopher&#039;s philosopher</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>Michael Dummett, one of the greatest English philosophers of the twentieth century, died late in December at the age of 86. He was a logician and a metaphysician, and also, incidentally, an expert on Tarot cards, which, he insisted, were for playing games with, not for divination.  His first major work, the enormous Frege: Philosophy of Language, published in 1973, was a groundbreaking study of Gottlob Frege, the late 19th and early 20th century German mathematician and logician.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>In a world of environmental crisis, what can philosophy tell us?  Who is qualified to pronounce on the subject and how do the institutions of science (peer-reviewed journals the like) help?  How do we model the situation in which we find ourselves and how do we decide which species to save, the most endangered or the easiest to save?</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>The inconsistency of Hannah Arendt</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>Hannah Arendt’s life describes a tragically typical twentieth century trajectory.  Born in Germany and, fleeing the Nazis, she ended up in the United States, where she died in 1975.  As a philosopher – a title she disclaimed – she insisted on the importance of thinking in the world and not trying to be above it and she thought that understanding the richness and variety of the world was more important than attaining a consistent view of it. This week, we look at a very worldly thinker.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>We’ve heard a lot in recent times about the legal wrangles of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange but there is another Wikileaker facing life in prison who has been given much less attention: Private Bradley Manning. Bradley Manning is accused of leaking thousands of classified defence documents and faces life in prison if found guilty. Over two hundred legal scholars and philosophers have signed a petition claiming his treatment has been unconstitutional and unethical.

      <title>Daniel Dennett on human consciousness and free will</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>This week on The Philosopher&#039;s Zone we meet one of the foremost thinkers of our time.</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>This week on The Philosopher's Zone we meet one of the foremost thinkers of our time. Daniel Dennett is Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University. Described as the great de-mystifier of consciousness, Dennett has been quoted as saying he developed a deep distrust of the methods he saw other philosophers employing and decided that before he could trust his intuitions about the mind, he had to figure out how the brain could possibly accomplish the mind's work.</description>

      <title>The artist and the philosopher - Gustav Klimt and Ludwig Wittgenstein</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>In the last decades of the Hapsburg empire, from 1895 to 194, the city of Vienna was opulent, elegant and daring.</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>In the last decades of the Hapsburg empire, from 1895 to 194, the city of Vienna was opulent, elegant and daring. A group of radical young artists, architects, writers, musicians, designers and thinkers were busy overturning all the rules. This week, we meet two of the brightest stars to have arisen in this febrile world, the enigmatic artist Gustav Klimt and the elusive philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and we look at Klimt through the changing gaze of Wittgenstein.</description>

      <title>Pascal&#039;s Wager - betting on God</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>This week on The Philosopher&#039;s Zone we&#039;re wagering on God.</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>This week on The Philosopher's Zone we're wagering on God. Well, why not? What have we got to lose? If God doesn't exist, we lose nothing; if he does, we gain everything. This is the famous argument known as 'Pascal's wager' after the great seventeenth-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. This week, we examine the wager and try to work what our odds are.</description>

      <description>Martin Buber was born in pre-Nazi Austria and emigrated to Israel in 1938 where he spent much of the rest of his life. He grappled with Zionism, Jewish thought, secular philosophy and politics and the result is a body of thought very much based on relationships.</description>
